# FetchEmails

This is a python scrip that uses the python selenium driver to fetch the emails of all recognized student clubs at utm.

You can modify this script to use different search query starting urls.
The line you would want to change in that case would be line 17: ```page = "/organizations/list/campus/utm/page/{}/type/all".format(pg_num)```
